# Teascript
For people who don't like coffee.

> This is an updated language idea with brand new syntax that is not compatible
> with the old TeaScript, which is no longer maintained.

## Usage
Currently only basic command line usage for transpiling one file at a time.

```
tea file <input file> <output file>
```

## TODO
- await/yield in do
- more number formats
- add dir transpiling to cli
