###
If statements do not require parens around the condition.
TeaScript treats all ifs as guard clauses which means every if must return as
the last statement in the block, and there is no else.
The guard keyword can be used interchangibly with if.

if value == other {
    # stuff
    => "return value"
}
guard anotherThing != false {
    # stuff
    => "return value"
}
