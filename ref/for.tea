###
For loops are the only loop in TeaScript.
Parens are not needed around the loop condiitions.
For loops can iterate over collections or ranges, or run infinitely.
Loop variables are always constant.

# Collection
for item : collection {
}

for item : list {
    # Not Allowed
    item = someValue
}

# Range
for x : 0 -> 100 {
}

# Infinite
for ever {
}
