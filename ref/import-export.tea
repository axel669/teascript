###
import works the same as in JS.
export has syntactic sugar for the object-style export syntax
###

import "some-core-thing.js"

import fs from "fs"
import {Worker} from "worker_threads"
import * as thing from "some-lib"

export default thing
export let value <+ 0
export mut why <+ null
export {
    otherThing
    moreThings as betterThings
}
