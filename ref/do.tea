TeaScript do expressions are for grouping code that should exist in its own
block, but isnt a function (or an iife). The value of the do expression is
the first returned value in the block (like a function). The TeaScript do
expression is more powerful than the proposed JS keyword beacuse it allows
any code that would go inside a function.

let value = do {
    let list = values()
    for item : list {
        guard item < 0 {
            => null
        }
    }
    => list
}
